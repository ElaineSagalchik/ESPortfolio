<!--Problem----------------------------------------------->
    <p class = "projectsection">PROBLEM</p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        Stroke diagnosis and management is extremely difficult in low-income countries, where 
        there is a lack of medical resources such as equipment and trained personnel.
    </p>

<!--Requirements----------------------------------------------->
    <p class = "projectsection">REQUIREMENTS</p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        • Work with four peers to design a technology for stroke prevention
    </p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        • Analyze current approaches to stroke prevention
    </p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        • Perform a value-analysis of the proposed design and identify its limitations
    </p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">

    </p>

<!--Solution----------------------------------------------->
    <p class = "projectsection">SOLUTION OVERVIEW</p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        We would like to target individuals in low- and middle-income countries as mortality 
        rates from strokes are ten times higher there than in richer nations (Ovbiagele et al.). 
        Given that individuals from these countries often lack access to physicians with stroke 
        expertise or advanced technologies, such as iPhones, our solution is not a mobile app, 
        and does not assume any medical or technical expertise (Bridging the Gap). Additionally, 
        given that our target audience will not have great financial means, our team wants to propose 
        a product that will be located in a communal space, allowing as many people as possible to 
        view and access our technology.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        Our solution is a virtual clinic powered by a VR headset, video camera, and microphone. A VR 
        headset will be placed in an accessible area, such as a pharmacy or a community center, so that 
        it can be reached by many individuals. A camera will be located nearby and pointed towards the VR 
        headset so that it can record the actions of those who use it. Likewise, a microphone will be placed 
        near the VR headset to record sound, specifically the statements of the individuals who use the VR 
        headset.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        The hardware of the system is simple - a VR headset, video camera, and built-in microphone - 
        and the virtual clinic is a program run by the VR system. Once an individual puts the headset 
        on, he/she will see a clinic and a doctor avatar. The virtual doctor will communicate with the 
        wearer and ask the patient to perform specific tasks to check for symptoms of stroke. The first 
        task for the user is to walk 20 steps around the virtual clinic, during which the wearer’s heart 
        rate and acceleration is monitored. The second task is to repeat a phrase or sentence that the 
        doctor says  to detect any slurring of speech. The third task is to mimic the virtual doctor’s 
        actions by lifting his/her arms, which will reveal any numbness or weakness in the user’s arms. 
        After the wearer completes these three tasks, he/she will be asked to self-report any known 
        symptoms. The entire session will be recorded (including the motion data collected by the VR 
        system) and sent to a physician abroad for analysis at the conclusion of the appointment.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        Our solution aims to tackle the obstacle of accessibility. As mentioned prior, strokes are ten 
        times more prevalent in low- and middle-income nations, primarily because doctors with stroke 
        expertise cannot easily access patients in these countries, preventing opportunities for early 
        detection and prevention (Ovbiagele et al.). Our system bridges the gap between physicians and 
        patients in these areas and provides accurate data for stroke detection, such as irregular heart 
        rate, uneven step acceleration, slurring of speech, numbness/weakness in the arms, and headaches 
        and dizziness (self-reported). Furthermore, our solution differs from contemporary virtual visits 
        such as telestroke as it creates an immersive environment for patients through the addition of 
        virtual reality, which can improve the quality of the data collected and thus allow physicians to 
        improve the quality of their care through more accurate diagnosis (De la Peña et al.). Additionally, 
        since our system is focused on delivering the data collected during virtual visits to doctors rather 
        than placing them in the virtual visit itself, physicians no longer need to take the time to be 
        trained to use the system, thereby removing a common barrier that telestroke faces. Thus, by 
        connecting physicians to remote patients and increasing the overall quality of treatments, our 
        solution improves physician-value by decreasing hospitalizations for stroke, therefore freeing 
        resources for other uses.
    </p>
    <p></p>

<!--Value Analysis----------------------------------------------->
<p class = "projectsection">VALUE ANALYSIS</p>
<p class = "projectdescription">
    Upon implementing our system in low- and middle-income communities, we will collect various 
    data from the visits to evaluate our solutions’s value to physicians. Our primary goal is to 
    provide physician access to patients in hard-to-reach communities, which creates opportunities 
    for early detection and prevention and thus decreases the number of hospitalizations due to 
    stroke. Indirectly, we  would also like to decrease the cost of stroke diagnosis and treatment 
    for physicians, enhance physician efficiency by freeing them up to see more patients, and 
    increase the quality of physician treatments by providing doctors with accurate data quickly. 
    To measure how well our solution meets our goals, we will measure changes in hospitalizations 
    rates for strokes in areas where our solution is currently implemented and distribute patient 
    and physician surveys to examine the indirect goals listed above.
</p>
<p></p>
<p class = "projectdescription">
    The best way to prevent strokes is to identify at-risk people and catch stroke symptoms 
    before the damage becomes too catastrophic. Low- to middle-income people do not have enough 
    access to medical care, claiming that “most commonly reported barriers across studies were 
    transport difficulties, financial difficulties and attitudes of staff” (Bright, 2018). By 
    implementing VR clinics in public spaces, such as pharmacies or communal areas, users will 
    face fewer transport difficulties to access a medical provider, and VR consultation eliminates 
    potential issues of staff quality. By measuring the number of people who visit our clinics and 
    the number of repeated visits, we can gauge changes in the number of physician-patients 
    connections in scenarios that would’ve otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, by recording the 
    number of patients admitted to nearby hospitals following their VR visits, we can compare the 
    percent of hospitalizations among VR users to that of non-VR users in similar areas to analyze 
    if our solution is decreasing the number of strokes in these communities over a 5- and 10-year 
    period.
</p>
<p></p>
<p class = "projectdescription">
    Our second goal to increase physician-value is to increase doctor efficiency in the office. 
    Strokes cost our healthcare system an estimated $36.5 to $65 billion a year, with projections 
    to exceed $180 billion by 2030  (Johnson et. al, 2016). Physician fees not only play a large 
    role in that sum, but the marginal cost of patients missing appointments and disturbing 
    organized office workflow adds to that cost as well. By making stroke consultations virtual, 
    doctors will no longer need to rely on patients’ transportation, and can thus work on more 
    patients in a day. To measure the quality of physician diagnoses based on VR videos and the 
    accuracy of our data, we will conduct a monthly survey with participating physicians that 
    collects the number of patients they helped that month, the number of stroke misdiagnoses 
    due to inaccurate data from the VR system, and the doctors’ opinions on the success of the 
    virtual visit. Additionally, patients will receive a survey to measure their satisfaction with 
    their care. By analyzing both sides, we will be able to determine if the doctor increased both 
    the number of patients seen in a day and the quality of their care. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p class = "projectdescription">
    We plan to observe changes in these aspects within the first year. After 5 years 
    following implementation, we will analyze the results of our solution and compile an 
    accurate overview of our platform’s value to physicians. We will then continue to monitor 
    the results of our solution for the remaining 5 years to analyze the long-term sustainability 
    of our solution.

<!--Limitations----------------------------------------------->
    <p class = "projectsection">LIMITATIONS</p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        While the benefits of our proposal are vast, a few possible limitations may exist. 
        Firstly, placing patients, who may be undergoing a stroke, in an unknown environment 
        or one that is greatly different from the natural world may produce great shock and 
        hinder mental-alignment. By replacing “sensory information from the physical world, 
        users may partially replace their sense of presence in the physical world, or in their 
        physical body” (Won et al., 2016). This phenomenon may lead to inaccurate movements 
        depicted by the patient, as the tests required by our system are heavily relied on 
        physical movement. It will be, then, vital for the success of our technology that the 
        patient is given time to accommodate to the VR and she is immersed gradually in order 
        to slowly gain comfortability and acceptance. Secondly, the onboarding costs of implementing 
        VR technology may pose a threat to the accessibility of virtual stroke diagnoses. While 
        most hospitals are equipped with the necessary tools to correctly diagnose a stroke, such 
        as a CT and MRI scanner, they will need to spend additional capital expenditure to expand 
        to a VR-compatible schema. Such investments may range from a $800 to upwards of $15,000 
        depending on the processing power and tools the clinic needs. However, we believe that the 
        overall improvements in the speed of diagnoses, as well as the newfound ability for 
        patients in low/middle income countries to receive stroke treatment, justify the high costs.
    </p>

<!--Path to Adoption----------------------------------------------->
    <p class = "projectsection">PATH TO ADOPTION</p>
    <p class = "projectdescription">
        Long-term, our proposal will occur in three phases. First, we will find shared spaces, 
        such as a room in a grocery store, pharmacy, or community center and install the necessary 
        hardware components. To create multiple virtual clinics in various locations, we will 
        need to purchase several sets of VR systems. Once the installation of the system is 
        complete, the virtual clinic is ready to be used. The second phase of our proposal will 
        be to increase awareness of our system and encourage regular virtual visits via outreach 
        and advertisement to locals in the surrounding areas. Due to the novelty of our system, 
        many users may be skeptical or wary of using our model. Thus, we will need to find ways to 
        bridge this gap and establish trust between both the physicians and patients. If our 
        solution is successful, we would eventually like to open additional virtual clinics to 
        increase the coverage of our service and increase the number of areas that physicians can 
        help. Finally, once our system becomes more accepted by users and if VR headsets become 
        extremely affordable, we would like to transition our system to individually-owned headsets, 
        allowing physicians to deliver care without requiring patients to leave the comfort of their 
        homes.
