<!--Problem----------------------------------------------->
        <p class = "projectsection">PROBLEM</p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            Cornell undergraduate students who live off-campus frequently utilize single-use 
            plastics. These students often do not have a meal plan, so they cook for themselves 
            and eat out. It is easy to buy groceries/meals pre-packaged in plastic and convenient 
            to reach for  plastic utensils at a cafe, but these habits produce large amounts of 
            single-use plastic waste, which are extremely harmful to the environment.

        <p class = "projectdescription">
            We interviewed 10 people who fit our user group, asking about their typical day to gain
            a sense of their habits. We asked questions about what they believed to be prevalent
            on-campus issues, whether they bought or cooked lunch, where they shopped for 
            groceries, and if they consider themsleves to be environmentall conscious. One person in 
            our group facilitated the interview while another team member took notes.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            We organized our interview notes into an affinity diagram with six categories: 
            Eating Habits, Living Habits, Convenience, Awareness, Attitudes, and On-Campus.

        <p></p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            We found three main takeaways:
        </p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            • Our user group considers their actions ineffective, feeling powerless with regard to
            environmental initiatives.
        </p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            • All options for buying food on-campus and close to campus come in 
            disposable - usually plastic - containers.
        </p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            • Our user groups tends to prioritize convenience over sustainable habits.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p class = "projectdescription">
            We then explored the solutions space through online research. As a group, we 
            scrutinized 20 existing products and noted their strengths and weaknesses. 
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p class = "processcat">Prototyping</p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            After becoming familar with the solution space, we began to brainstorm our mobile app. 
            We made lo-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq.

        <p class = "projectdescription">
            We conducted short usability tests on our lo-fidelity prototype to identify pain 
            points in the user journey. We made four main changes when moving from the lo-fidelity 
            to the high-fidelity Figma prototype:
        </p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            • Removed punchcard screen. Users instead collect points on the home screen.
        </p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            • Added back buttons and shortcuts for ease of use.
        </p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            • Changed nav bar icons and labelled them for clarity.
        </p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            • Narrowed reward options to only include discounts and items redeemable in-person .
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p class = "processcat">Usability Testing</p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            We greeted the participant, and asked for their name and major. We then 
            described the app and our motivation behind it, explaining that the app 
            encourages students to partake in sustainable behaviors in on-campus eateries. 
            We said that we would ask the participant to perform four tasks on our prototype 
            and that they can stop the usability test if they feel uncomfortable. After this 
            introduction, we provided an informed consent form for the participant to look over. 
            Once it was signed, we asked the participant to complete the following: earn points, 
            use points to redeem a reward, refer a friend to the app, and like someone’s in-app 
            status/action.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            After the tasks were complete, we asked the participant to describe their overall 
            experience with TapTurtle. We also asked the participant to describe the app in 
            their own words, and to explain what they liked most and least about the app. Then, 
            we asked the participant if they had any questions and answered them, if any. We 
            concluded the session by thanking the participant for their time and telling them to 
            reach out if they had any additional questions.
