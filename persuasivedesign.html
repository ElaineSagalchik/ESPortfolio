        <p class = "projectdescription">
            Many campus eateries offer plastic utensils and students absentmindedly reach for them, 
            use them for one meal, and dispose of them. This leads to a build-up of non-durable 
            plastic utensils in the environment and endangers wildlife. Animals can get trapped in 
            plastic, eat it, and become sick. Even though most students know that non-durable plastics 
            are harmful to the environment, they continue to use them instead of bringing their own 
            reusable cutlery.

<!--Solution----------------------------------------------->
        <p class = "projectsection">SOLUTION OVERVIEW</p>
        <p class = "projectdescription">
            The Environmental Central is a set of friendship bracelets that are linked together 
            via a network on a user’s phone. Each bracelet is able to detect when its wearer sits 
            down for a meal and automatically snaps a picture of the utensils the user has picked 
            up. It then sends this picture to a general conversation space that everyone in the 
            network is in. Once a picture is sent, everyone else in the network is notified and 
            can reply to it.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p class = "projectdescription">
            The affordance that the Environmental Central instantiates is that of providing social 
            support and sanctions. This means that it plays on people’s desire to connect with and 
            please their friends as well as not be ashamed in front of them. The way that this 
            design implements this affordance is by allowing various users to form a connected 
            network that lets them communicate with each other. This aspect of the Environmental 
            Central appeases people’s desire to connect with other. Another aspect of this design 
            that implements this affordance is the general conversation space where users can 
            compare their actions with those of others. This platform is where users can charm 
            their friends and be faced with social sanctions. Since users can see what types of 
            utensils other people in their network are using and what comments follow each one, 
            they can determine what actions are perceived positively and negatively. For instance, 
            if the picture sent to the general conversation space is a meal accompanied by metal 
            utensils, then others in the network will respond with positive comments, and the user 
            will be encouraged to keep using metal utensils in order to keep raking in positive 
            responses. However, if the picture contains non-durable plastic utensils, then others 
            will respond with negative comments, and the user will feel ashamed. This will cause the 
            user to steer away from using non-durable plastic utensils and drive the user to use 
            reusable utensils to stop receiving negative replies. 
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p class = "projectdescription">
            The design’s implementation of this persuasive affordance will change users’ 
            patterns of plastic utensil use. Considering that users will be applauded when their 
            pictures contain reusable utensils and derided when they contain non-durable plastic 
            ones, users will be discouraged from reaching for disposable plastic utensils during 
            their meals. They will be pushed to use the metal utensils available or to purchase 
            their own portable cutlery set. Ultimately, by invoking social support and sanctions, 
            the Environmental Central urges its users to cut down on using disposable plastic 
            utensils, hence decreasing plastic build-up in the environment and conserving wildlife.

                College students nonchalantly use plastic utensils, toss them out, and add to 
                plastic waste. About 40 billion individual plastic utensils are produced yearly 
                in the U.S, and due to low rates of reuse and recycling, 6 million of them are 
                thrown out each year. In order to strive towards sustainability, this number 
                should be reduced by at least 50%.
