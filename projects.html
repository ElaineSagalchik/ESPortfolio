        <h1>Hi, I'm Elaine!</h1>
        <p class = "about center">I’m a solution-agnostic UX strategist and product designer 
            focused on making a positive impact. I strive to create simple, 
            accessible, and equitable products that place people at the center 
            of problem-solving. I’m passionate about exploring the social and 
            cultural values that design (un)consciously promotes to continuously 
            innovate the world as we know it. I’m a relentless learner, creator, 
            and optimist based in NYC.</p>
