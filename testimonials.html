            “Elaine has been great to work with! Her technical vocabulary and user-oriented 
            approach to design and development has had huge impacts on our team's overall strategy. 
            Coming from a technical background myself, I place huge value on someone that can 
            'speak the language' and provide her own insight. I have no hesitation reaching out to 
            Elaine for future opportunities!”

            “Having worked with Elaine on various collaborations between our respective student 
            organizations during our time at Cornell University, I have seen firsthand her ability 
            to brainstorm innovative solutions to challenging problems faced while she served as 
            the president of POLIS, the political fraternity on campus. Whether it be developing 
            open-minded solutions to increasing engagement within her organization or spearheading 
            unique collaborations with organizations such as the Roosevelt Institute, where I served 
            as Director of External Affairs, Elaine was always willing to think outside of the box 
            and work with others to ensure that all parties involved had the best outcome from 
            whatever event was being planned.”
