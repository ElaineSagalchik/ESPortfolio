            “Having worked with Elaine on various collaborations between our respective student 
            organizations during our time at Cornell University, I have seen firsthand her ability 
            to brainstorm innovative solutions to challenging problems faced while she served as 
            the president of POLIS, the political fraternity on campus. Whether it be developing 
            open-minded solutions to increasing engagement within her organization or spearheading 
            unique collaborations with organizations such as the Roosevelt Institute, where I served 
            as Director of External Affairs, Elaine was always willing to think outside of the box 
            and work with others to ensure that all parties involved had the best outcome from 
            whatever event was being planned.”
